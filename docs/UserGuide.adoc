== Introduction

=== What is Bibliotek

Bibliotek is a free book cataloguing application that is simple, fast and easy to use.
You can use Bibliotek to search for books, manage your reading list and track the availability of your books.

If you *prefer to use a desktop app*, like *working with a Command Line Interface* (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI) or can *type fast*, Bibliotek is just for you!
